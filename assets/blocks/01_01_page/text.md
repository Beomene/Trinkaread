**PART 1: THE CAFÉ** *
---
The café smelled like burnt espresso and the ghost of Lina’s last bad decision. Eene clutched her tea like a lifeline, the chipped rim pressing into her palm. Across the table, Juni leaned in, her grin sharp as a **daggerblossom thorn**.  
**Juni**: *“So. *How* did you two—”*  
**Emraa** kicked her under the table. *“*Don’t*.”*  
Eene’s soul-token **glowed crimson** in Trinkaloop’s ledger. She counted the sugar packets to avoid Emraa’s gaze—*green eyes like tax audits, smug and merciless*.  
**Lina** (mouth full of cinnamon roll): *“Eene, you *exist* outside the library! Is the apocalypse nigh?”*  
**Mikael** (scarf strangling him): *“Your thoughts on *metaphorical snowfall* in post-structuralist cinema—”*  
Eene opened her mouth. Closed it. The **fox** under the table stole her left mitten. *For balance.*  
Emraa’s fingers brushed her wrist—*a spark, a claim*—and the world narrowed to that touch.  
**Emraa** (*low, for Eene alone*): *“Breathe. They’re *terrified* of you.”*  
Eene snorted. *Liar.* But her shoulders relaxed.

<!-- STICKER: 01_01_stickerB -->
Lyl's petals rustled as the corgi-shaped oikio...

**Juni** (grinning): *"Ohhh, she *blushes*! Emraa, you *fiend*—"*  
A **huldrefox** leapt onto the table, neon fur crackling. It dropped a **polaroid** in Eene's lap—*Emraa mid-eye-roll, captioned "Mine" in jagged script*.  
**Emraa** (*deadpan*): *"Traitor."*  
The fox stole her cigarette. *For balance.*  
*(Static crescendos—to be continued in Chapter 3's karaoke meltdown.)*

*(P.S. The fox now demands a karaoke solo. **Fight me.**)* 🎤🦊

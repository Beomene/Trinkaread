The moon hung low over Blackwald Forest, its silver light filtering through the twisted branches. A chill wind carried the scent of damp earth and something metallic—something old.
I tightened my grip on the Trinkaloop, its strange warmth pulsing against my palm. Twenty years of searching, and now it had chosen this moment to awaken. The shadows between the trees seemed to breathe in time with its glow. "You're late," whispered the voice from the darkness. No—not a voice. The words formed directly in my mind, oily and cold. The shadow detached itself from the tree line, taller than any man, its edges flickering like candle smoke. The Trinkaloop's heat became unbearable. I knew then what the legends meant about the Gatekeepers. They weren't guardians. They were locks. And I'd just handed them the key.
